User Story:
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

Acceptance Criteria:
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
<!-- Changed divs to header, aside, and section to be proper sematic elements -->

WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
<!-- Added id for search-engine-optimization -->

WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
<!-- Added alt attribute to six images -->
<!-- Added title attribute to background image to serve as alternative to alt-->

WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
<!--Changed footer h2 to h4 to fall in sequential order-->

WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
<!-- Changed title element to "Horiseon" -->

Application's links all function correctly.
<!--Fixed link for Search engine optimization -->

Application's CSS selectors and properties are consolidated and organized to follow semantic structure.
<!--Consolidated and organized CSS duplicates-->

Application's CSS file is properly commented.
<!--Commented on changes and page flow-->
